# CoronaVirus
This is a data analysis and visualization of Corona Virus spread in south korea
The link to the dataset is here:

I will not include the used data in the git repository, but you can find it and download it from the kaggle link.

Edit: The map doesnt show in the opened notebook on github, but it should work if you download the file and use it on google colab.
